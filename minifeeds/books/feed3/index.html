        <p>The other stories here were &quot;A Man and His Dog&quot; (1918), &quot;Disorder and Early Sorrow&quot; (1925), &quot;The Transposed Heads&quot; (1940), &quot;The Tables of the Law&quot; (1944), and &quot;The Black Swan&quot; (1953). I'm typically not much of a short story reader but I do really love Thomas Mann and also &quot;Mario and the Magician&quot; is an early fictional depiction of hypnosis, so it's relevant to my research for my next novel lol... Anyways these are all more novella-length. I was surprised how much I got into them even though the basic subject matter of most of them... dogs? A pastiche of early translations of Indian myths? The book of Exodus??? ... were things that I would typically say are almost certainly uninteresting. But no, I do just really like the way he writes about the experience of philosophy and thought alongside daily life, internal contradictions, embarrassing impulses, etc, no matter what his sensibility is put towards. &quot;The Tables of the Law&quot; surprised me; I'm familiar with &quot;realist&quot; takes on bible stories and often find them even more tediously cheesy than the original text. But this one introduced a perverse and very human cynicism and self interest, to Moses, but also to God Himself, that broke through my initial resistance to the topic. &quot;The Black Swan&quot; is also notable for having a scene where I had to dog ear the corner of the page for it being so horny. I think people really sell short how weird and also funny Thomas Mann is, this made me want to go in on my long-threatened <em>The Magic Mountain</em> reread soon.</p>
