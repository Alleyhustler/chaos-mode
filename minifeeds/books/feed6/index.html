        <p>I was really excited to read this one and really wanted to like it as someone who sees my own output as like, satirizing or joking about work to articulate an anti-work position. And the first few chapters were great on how comedy can both propose gradual reconsideration of the existing work-oriented capitalist order, reinforce it by offering a positive vision of &quot;fun&quot; or community at work, or just straight up blow a hole in its fictions. The section about the historical development of comedy clubs, and how comedians at one club held a somewhat successful strike even though most of them weren't being paid, and were expected to be thankful for the &quot;education&quot; they were receiving being allowed to perform, was also really cool to read about.</p>
<p>But the middle third becomes a slog because it is dominated by the topic of high profile comedian cancellations. This was tough for me for two reasons: A) it seemed only tangentially related to to the topic of comedy in the sense that comedy is a workplace where sexual harassment and hate speech and so on is excused due to seeing the work as &quot;creative,&quot; &quot;speaking truth&quot; or coming from a place of &quot;tortured genius.&quot; However, (and this part of the book spreads out to accommodate this) this is basically true of any &quot;creative&quot; career, academia, and even like, the self-conceptualization of middle management. And B) Even when I agree with the critique of, ie, Louis CK, Dave Chappelle, Ricky Gervais, etc... all these cases have been discussed to death for better and for way way worse online, so it feels honestly like a better use of my time to never hear about them again.</p>
<p>But these sections also have the weakest argumentation, imo, because it often relies on labeling the objects of its criticism with pop-psychology Bad Person dismissal terms (someone's oeuvre is &quot;narcissistic&quot; or &quot;toxic&quot;, a particular ideology or relation to comedy is a &quot;disease&quot;) rather than actually articulating their specific elements, while also relying on the move of seeing the artistic output as something that either logically emerged from or logically resulted in that person being abusive, which is like, not a move I care to make! Sure, Ricky Gervais played an annoying, pompous, self-victimizing asshole boss on the UK version of the office and then became a weird self-victimizing &quot;anti-cancel culture&quot; warrior, but what do you say about Steve Carrell, whose reputation is (so far as I know) fine, but whose scrubbed up, friendlier version of the same character and framing of it in the US TV show is a much more demobilizing and problematic depiction of work rather than a critique??? I think the fact that you can't make broad moral claims or conclusions in this area is the whole purpose and task of arts criticism. But anyways.</p>
<p>There was another chapter about skit comedy and netflix streaming as a type of &quot;care work&quot; in the early period of the COVID-19 pandemic which I also found really interesting and a good connection to make. A positive of this book is that it does consider housework and the normative reproduction of society in general to also be places where &quot;work in comedy/comedy about work&quot; emerges. This is hyperspecific but I kind of wish it did that wrt the work neurodivergent and disabled people also have to do to shore up others' self-esteem in public life, by not being &quot;too abnormal&quot; or making anyone uncomfortable. But the Chapter on Telehealth therapy over the same period being connected to the &quot;therapeutic listening&quot; quality of humor and self-help podcasts was kind of baffling (and again mostly more tangentially related to the topic): there was a nice wrap-up paragraph about how these things are all sustaining and helpful, so I expect to reach the second half of the chapter that will trouble this for obvious reasons (The use of mental healthcare as worker discipline at jobs and schools, the exploitative data collecting and advertising model of BetterHelp which is so entangled with those same podcasts etc) when I turn the page, but no, that's it, the end! The conclusion was like, fine, with some sort of by now uninspiring proposals about &quot;play&quot; and &quot;collectivity&quot; as the positive qualities of comedy, but I really wanted more analysis of comedic depictions of work or comedy themed around work itself, and more of a statement at the end.... idk! Read the chapters I thought were good if the topic interests you but I could really take or leave the others.</p>
