        <p>Instead of flights of fancy and bliss, this book makes love seem usually unpleasant. But, when Barthes says &quot;A figure is established if at least someone can say: <em>That's so true! I recognize that scene of language</em>&quot;, I had to admit I was doing a lot of this while reading this book. I often don't like who I am when I fall in love-- I become even more neurotic, reactive, unreasonable... it seems like a similar stupidity passive effect to being angry... both of which are states which can be subsumed under the &quot;passions.&quot; A lot of love is waiting, thinking, re-thinking, and disappointment, even in the midst of its consummation, even with the love object present. I loved the sources on love he brought together, truly a wonderful/weird sensibility that I feel a kinship with as someone who feels a crush as extreme, often unpleasant, but also vital, also exhilarating existential wrangling. Read, at the very least, for clarity on things as specific and scrupulous as why &quot;I feel the same&quot; is a blatantly inadequate response to the love-cry(!!) of &quot;I love you!&quot;</p>
