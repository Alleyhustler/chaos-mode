        <p><p>I was so busy between my last post and now that I thought I might have brought burnout on myself just by thinking/posting about it. lol.</p></p>
<p><a href="https://itch.io/jam/alternative-ecologies-jam">Alternative Ecologies Jam</a> went well! It was a bit more stressful than the others I've run because just about as soon as it started I had a strong sense of how much shorter 3 days was than a week. So naturally, we got less entries and they came in a cluster at the end rather than throughout but I think the quality is overall really good! My entry is on the mildly-trolly mildly-serious idea of a <a href="https://emreed.net/Proof_of_Rest.html">"Proof-of-Rest" protocol</a>. HM! I obviously had something on my mind.</p>
<p>I've also updated the <a href="https://emreed.net/LowTech_Directory.html">Low Tech Webring</a>, and left it open when/if I'll next update. It's a huge number of sites now, and while I find them all great and interesting and charming in their own ways, it's kind of become a huge endeavor for one person and idk if a webring is the best or most sustainable way to present all these sites together. <a href="mailto:emilie.m.reed@gmail.com">I'm open to discussions on it!</a></p>
<p><a href="https://plaintextdistro.neocities.org/">Plaintext Distro</a> is now open to purchases, and I will be mailing all the zines at the end of the month. Currently, it's just a way for me and a few low tech oriented friends to distribute zines in a very casual, at-cost way, but I'd like to extend it to feature a lot of different publications around those themes. It's a part of <a href="https://glasgowzinelibrary.com/fair">Glasgow Zine Fair</a> which takes place over all of April.</p>
<p>The job interview went well, I've been invited for a second-round interview. Yay! I also have some paid writing lined up after much pain and anguish (turns out there are two outlets who will pay me a non-offensive amount to publish my work, remaining, on earth), and additional production/facilitation work to keep me busy through april/may (which is... convenient since that job would start in June if I get it!)</p>
<p>It's getting warmer here gradually and we've even had a few sunny days that got up to 15/16 C! But it's making me realize how much I miss walking into town, going to the local shops I liked, getting a bubble tea and sitting in the square, etc, all the things that have not quite become possible again yet due to COVID. I hope under 50s can start getting vaccinated soon here. I am planning to get a nice pizza from an amazing local place across the street tomorrow!</p>
<p>Other than that, keeping my head down revising my VN script and reading on in <em>The Magic Mountain!</em> Recently, I've enjoyed reading <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2021/03/urban-fish-ponds-low-tech-sewage-treatment-for-towns-and-cities.html">the new Low Tech blog post about wastewater fish ponds</a> and <a href="https://thedisorderofthings.com/tag/slow-boat-to-china/">Charmaine Chua's blog series about riding on a container ship</a>. Yep, I think that's about it. Hope everyone is having a nice day and only getting fooled on in good spirits.</p>
