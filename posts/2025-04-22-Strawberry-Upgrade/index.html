        <p>I have been <a href="https://bagenzos.house/">Bagenzo's</a> guinea pig for some forthcoming features of <a href="https://strawberrystarter.neocities.org/">Strawberry Starter</a>, and now that they're all tested and ready to go this blog has some fun new parts! The main thing is:</p>
<h2>Mini-Feeds</h2>
<p>YES, you can now keep up with the short reviews of <a href="../../tags/books/index.html">books I'm reading</a>, my <a href="../../tags/gigs/index.html">gig diary</a>, and my experiments with <a href="../../tags/tarot/index.html">tarot draws and interpretations</a> (most recently using Suzanne Treister's fascinating <a href="https://www.suzannetreister.net/HEXEN2/HEXEN_2.html">Hexen 2.0</a> deck) by clicking on the tags at the top of the page. They will not show up in the main RSS feed of the site, which will continue to just be the main blog posts. HOWEVER, I made this site's theme look cool and I think it's fun to click around on, so actually looking at the website will always be imo the &quot;correct&quot; way to read it.</p>
<p>The update to Strawberry Starter will also make adding comment boxes easier, though I choose not to do that. The CSS is a bit nicer to work with and backups are easier to do with a built-in function. I am having a lot of fun setting up the feeds, tweaking the layout for my own purposes, and coming up with new mini-feeds to add (good food I ate? a zine digest? so much more!). Strawberry Starter is a really handy template and great for making a flexible static site blog. Obviously I highly recommend it, even moreso when these features will be public!</p>
<p>In other news, The <a href="https://domino.gallery/awards/domino-declassified-jam/">Domino: Declassified</a> awards were this weekend! I was able to reveal that I co-wrote <a href="https://dominoclub.itch.io/it-came-from-the-orgone-chamber">IT CAME FROM THE ORGONE CHAMBER</a> with <a href="https://spdrcstl.com/">Freya</a>, which was a really fun experience that I think turned out well! I wrote up more on my process and stuff for the other Domino Club members but I'm not sure if it's interesting/coherent enough to be worth posting here... All I'll say is I was glad to be working with someone because between revising novel 2 and life stuff I was totally tapped out on writing a whole story. It fulfilled my <a href="../2025-01-01-2024_wrap_up__Books__games__life__etc_/index.html">new year's resolution</a> to try collaborating with someone on a game, and in the end I think the two halves of the story plus the <a href="https://nebulous.group/index.php/projects/translations/mirrors/"><em>Mirrors</em></a>-like presentation in <a href="https://communistsister.itch.io/videotome-heartbreak">Videotome</a> works really well. We won the Johnny 5 award &quot;for looking after a precocious being desperate for input.&quot; You'll have to play the game to find out what that's about... hehe...</p>
<p>AND I put an <a href="https://emreed.net/Reframing_Abundance">edited transcript of the talk I've been giving</a> up on my <a href="https://emreed.net/">main portfolio site</a>. It puts a pin in my critical writing there for the time being; I'm much more on the practice end of things now and like using this blog for more light/casual writing that comes out of that.</p>
<p>Stephen and I are off to Dublin for May, so hopefully that leads to some interesting adventures! Hope you all have something nice to look forward to, too!</p>
