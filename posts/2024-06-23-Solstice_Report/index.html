        <p><p>It's been about three weeks now since my debut novel, <a href="https://emreed.net/more_bugs"><em>More Bugs</em></a>, officially &quot;came out,&quot; though in many cases this means copies are still travelling through the postal system, making their way to smaller shops, sitting in people's to-be-read piles, etc... In one sense it's been huge and exciting: my first big festival event! Reviews and ratings starting to come in! Seeing my book face out or on the table of local bookshops! But also, because the process of reading a novel is far from instant, it can also feel weirdly quiet.</p></p>
<p>As before, the book is available <a href="https://www.knighterrantpress.com/product-page/more-bugs-by-em-reed">direct from the publisher</a>, through <a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/more-bugs-em-reed/7641399?aid=13795&amp;ean=9781916665033">Bookshop.org</a>, and by request at any chain or indie bookstores in your area if they don't already stock it (which also helps by demonstrating interest in a small press' new release). The <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/213689586-more-bugs">Goodreads page</a> is also up and running now too, which is a great place to leave a rating or nice comment if you liked it (and I won't suggest any action if you hated it, lol).</p>
<p>Some more blurbs and reviews have also come in since last time:</p>
<blockquote>An insightful and thought-provoking portrait of suburban alienation and longing with a delightful dash of body horror. Through engrossing prose, Reed stealthily weaves the impossible and everyday to reveal the suffocating dread of our personal histories. -- Eve Harms, author of <em>Transmuted</em></blockquote>
<blockquote>With relatable characters and subtle speculative and horror elements, More Bugs intricately explores the isolating feeling of returning home as a stranger. As the seemingly suburban tale unravels, the book takes a satisfying turn into the surreal, delving into the dark desires that come from being tempted by the uncanny and unknown. -- Lyndsey Croal, author of <em>Have You Decided on Your Question</em></blockquote>
<p>But I was most moved by someone expressing their appreciation through my website's old school <a href="http://users4.smartgb.com/g/g.php?a=s&amp;i=g44-79892-79">guestbook</a>:</p>

<p>Cymera was great! The panel I was on tied together some really interesting work thematically, and I got to talk a lot about the inspirations for setting and character in <em>More Bugs</em>. I also got to sit in on some other interesting panels on sci-fi and publishing. Having my first signing was a little awkward... there's actually a bit more to think about then just putting pen to paper. But I did get an insect stamp set to add a little bonus to any future signings:</p>

<p>The next confirmed event for the book will be at Knight Errant's table in the <a href="https://glasgow2024.org/whats-on/dealers-room/">Dealer's Room at Worldcon</a>, where I will intermittently be present to sign books. There will also be some more events and bookstore signings later in summer/fall, so keep an eye out for more emails about that!</p>
<p>Otherwise, things are going well! My partner's major project for the last four years, <a href="https://thecatamites.itch.io/anthology-of-the-killer">Anthology of the Killer</a>, has been released and is getting lots of positive buzz. We also got to go to MP's fantastic Glasgow gig. I've been spinning <a href="https://mannequinpussy.bandcamp.com/album/i-got-heaven-2">their new album</a>, as well as the new stuff by <a href="https://shellac.bandcamp.com/album/to-all-trains">Shellac</a> and <a href="https://shannonandtheclams.bandcamp.com/album/the-moon-is-in-the-wrong-place">Shannon and the Clams</a>.</p>
<p>The last three weeks have also been a huge improvement in recovering from the radical reduction I underwent earlier this year. I feel a lot less timid about moving my body around, the scars are chilling out, and my energy levels are, well, better than ever! Even though I described it as an instant improvement, I feel like I'm just now beginning to appreciate life with just over 2 kilos off my chest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyways, because you read this whole thing, here's a <a href="https://emreed.net/secret/Breastdump-1.pdf">sneaky link</a> (that's what you call it nowadays, right?) to a PDF of the zine about my reduction that I debuted at Glasgow Zine Fair this year. It went over really well so is technically out of print for now, but I'm still proud of it.</p>
<p>It's halfway through the year! My resolutions this year were to take care of the surgery and get my ear pierced (done and done) but also to finish a draft of my second novel and pick up rollerblading again. I haven't done the last two yet but plan to dig in to at least one this evening...</p>
<p>Hope you are all well, and thanks for reading!</p>
